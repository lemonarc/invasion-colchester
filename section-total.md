    This spectacular total was made up of donations collected on the day, plus funds raised by the <strong>Film & TV Quiz</strong> nights, <strong>Mark Davies’</strong> charity art auction, the <strong>Prize Draw</strong>, and year-round fundraising — including <strong>Darth Vader’s Galactic Grotto</strong> and a <strong>North Primary School</strong> character visit.
</p><p>
    Our heartfelt thanks go to our sponsors and charity partners — including <strong>Ace Comics</strong>, <strong>Beresfords</strong>, <strong>Colchester Castle</strong>, <strong>Colchester City Council</strong>, <strong>Colchester Events</strong>, <strong>Culver Square</strong>, <strong>Curzon</strong>, <strong>Dragonfly Lounge</strong>, <strong>Fenwick</strong>, <strong>Film & TV Quiz</strong>, <strong>Lion Walk</strong>, <strong>Mark Davies</strong>, <strong>Park & Ride</strong>, <strong>BID / InColchester</strong>, <strong>St Helena Hospice</strong>, <strong>Colchester & Ipswich Hospitals Charity</strong>, and <strong>Mind (Mid & North East Essex)</strong> — for helping make this total possible.
</p><p>
    Thanks also to the companies and performers who donated time or money, our special guests, and every volunteer and costumer who gave up their day to bring the smiles and fill the buckets.
</p><p>
    And to everyone who joined us in 2025 — dressed up, donated, and cheered us on — thank you. Your generosity makes a real difference.
