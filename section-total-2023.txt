<p class="total">£<span class="counter" id="financial-counter">0</span></p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Thank you to all of our wonderful sponsors and charities for their incredible efforts last year to help us achieve this fantastic total including Culver Square, Lion Walk, Fenwick, Ace Comics, Colchester Events, Our Colchester, Colchester City Council and Market, St Helena Hospice, Colchester & Ipswich Hospitals Charity, Mind (Mid & North East Essex), and the guys who got sponsored to dress-up for the day.</p>
<p>Thanks also to Film TV & Music Quiz, MP Galleries, Community 360 Hub, Park & Ride, Diamond UK, DJ Fettdog, the live acts, our special guests, and to each and every volunteer and costumer who gave up their time for the day to hang out with us, spread some joy, and help us collect the all-important donations.</p>
<p>Lastly, thank you to all of you who came along in 2023 to enjoy Invasion Colchester, got dressed up, and dropped some coins or notes into our buckets. You will all have helped someone when they needed it.</p>
<p>See you again on <strong>7 September 2024!</strong></p>
