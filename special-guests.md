<h2>Nick Joseph</h2>

<p>
Nick became an actor by chance when when a friend of his who ran an agency for extras asked for help when she had been let her down at the last moment. He got the job, went home with £10 in his pocket and decided to enroll in a performing arts school.
</p><p>
In 1976, Nick's agent called to see if he would be interested in a low budget film called 'Star Wars' - the role was for the Medal Bearer in the final throneroom scene. Nick said yes, won the part and has forever been associated with it since.
</p><p>
In his career, Nick has worked on 'Doctor Who' with three different Doctors (Tom Baker, Peter Davidson and Colin Baker) as well as two episodes of 'Blakes 7', first as the Android in "Head Hunter" and then in "The Animals". He was the Armoury Officer in the James Bond film 'The Spy Who Loved Me', the Milkman in East Enders for the first three years and has also worked on 'The Incredible Sarah', 'We'll Meet Again', 'Secret Army' and 'The Manageress'. He has appeared in on many TV commercials, the best of which he says was working with Ayrton Senna (Nick played the role of Alain Prost and drove the F1 car as, at the time, he was an F3 race driver!).
</p><p>
Aside from acting, Nick also used to be a long distance runner, taking part in more than fifty marathons and many other long distance races!

</p><p>
In 2008, Sandeep was given the opportunity to play a small role in Eastenders and thereafter other opportunities in TV dramas.

Sandeep has also appeared on the big screen in major films such as 'Prince of Persia', 'Skyfall', 'Spectre', 'World War Z', 'Edge of Tomorrow', 'Burnt' and 'The Program'. In 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' he is the Stormtrooper that man-handles Lor San Tekka (Max Von Sydow) to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) for interrogation, as well as one of the two Stormtroopers in the comic corridor scene (the one that stops his fellow trooper), the Stormtrooper that interrogates the alien as the village is overtaken by troopers, the Stormtrooper that lies dead at the feet of Harrison Ford in the control room and the First Order Stormtrooper Squad Leader that marches with Kylo Ren in parts of the film.
</p><p>
Recently, Sandeep has appeared as a surgeon with Benedict Cumberbatch in 'Doctor Strange', a Scarif Trooper in 'Star Wars: Rogue One', a Policeman in 'Jason Bourne', a British Army Officer in 'Wonder Woman', a Snowtrooper Officer in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' and as Government Officials in both 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' and 'Justice League'.
</p><p>
More excitingly, you might spot Sandeep in the titles to the BBC comedy 'This Time... with Alan Partridge', sitting next to a certain Alan Partridge!
</p><p>
Sandeep has also appeared in Britney Spears' 'Criminal' music video as well as providing voice-work for Channel 4 News.

</p><p>
A keen collector of film memorabilia, in 2000 he was approached by the BBC to take part in a documentary called 'The Price of Fame'.
</p><p>
At the beginning of 2005 a work colleague asked Martin if he would be interested in appearing in a local theatre stage production. Martin agreed, and went on to play 7 different parts in a production of Vanity Fair.
</p><p>
In 2005, Martin was given a small role in the British film 'Cashback', written and directed by Sean Ellis, which starred, among others, Sean Biggerstaff from the 'Harry Potter' films. This appearance led to further small roles in films, including 'Heroes and Villains', 'Gasoline Blood', 'The Golden Compass' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum'.
</p><p>
In 2008, Martin worked on Christopher Nolan's second Batman film, 'The Dark Knight' in which he plays one of the Joker's Henchman, alongside the late Heath Ledger. After having worked with Warner Brother on the 'The Dark Knight', they requested Martin for 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince', in which he plays 'Scary Face'. He later played Mundungus Fletcher's friend in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1)'.
</p><p>
In addition to his film work, Martin appreared regularly in the first, second and third series of TV show 'Kingdom'.

<h2>Ralph Morse / Johnny Cashbox</h2>

<p>
With a career spanning over fifty years, Ralph is a multi-disciplined arts professional. He is an award winning theatre actor, (1980 – London Theatre Associates Best Actor), a playwright, director, singer-songwriter and teacher. His play 'Who is Leonard Jones' was premiered at the Headgate Theatre in Colchester, before touring East Anglia in 2007. In 2017 he began an association with Elysium Productions in America, as the writer/narrator of 'The Secret – A Star Wars Story', storywriter on 'Volkov' (2019) and as the movie screenwriter for 'Volkov Origin' (2022).
</p><p>
Ralph's film and television appearances include 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi', 'Moonraker', 'Flash Gordon', 'Blake's Seven', 'Doctor Who', and 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' - and those are just the sci-fi productions.
</p><p>
From 2003, Ralph's main stage persona has been the comical guitar-slinging, time-travelling space cowboy, Johnny Cashbox, whose appearances at Invasion Colchester are as legendary as the man himself. Johnny's sci-fi themed songs are very much part of the 'Star Wars' universe and you may very well see him mingling and entertaining everyone during the event.
