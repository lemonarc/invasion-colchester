    <h3>Carl Newman</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Carl Newman</strong> is an English dancer who served as Michael Keaton’s <em>movement double</em> in <strong>Batman (1989)</strong>. Unlike the other stunt performers who wore the Batsuit, Carl received a distinct on-screen credit and remains the only double to have his portrait taken by renowned photographer <strong>Herb Ritts</strong>.
    </p><p>
        A professional freelance dancer, Carl worked across various media and collaborated closely with Batsuit wrangler <strong>William Todd-Jones</strong> during pre-production. Together, they refined a more elegant way of moving in the restrictive costume. Footage of Carl suiting up was featured in <strong>Batman: The Making of a Hero</strong>, and he also led mime workshops for the seven actors portraying Joker’s goons, helping them choreograph their movements for the “Ricorso assassination” scene.
    </p><p>
        After principal photography concluded, Carl stayed on to participate in promotional photoshoots on the standing sets at Pinewood Studios. He was photographed by <strong>David Gamble</strong> for <strong>LIFE</strong> magazine alongside costume designer <strong>Bob Ringwood</strong> and production designer <strong>Anton Furst</strong>, and also appeared in other publications such as <strong>Time Out</strong> and <strong>Bravo</strong>.
